C binary trees

Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. 
A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. 
A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array 
and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array 
and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.



    Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

    Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

    Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

    Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

    Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

    Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

    Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

    Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

    Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

    keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

Basic Binary Tree

/**
* struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
*
* @n: Integer stored in the node
* @parent: Pointer to the parent node
* @left: Pointer to the left child node
* @right: Pointer to the right child node
  */
  struct binary_tree_s
  {
  int n;
  struct binary_tree_s *parent;
  struct binary_tree_s *left;
  struct binary_tree_s *right;
  };

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;

Binary Search Tree

typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;

AVL Tree
